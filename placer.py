"""Greedy task placer driven by a priority function.

A heuristic is `priority(step, state) -> float` (higher = place next). The
placer repeatedly picks the highest-priority eligible step (one whose prereq
is None or already placed) and commits it to its station at the earliest
time allowed by its prereq, the station's free slots, and the order's
arrival.

There is no global clock — each step's start/finish times are computed at
the moment it is placed. The heuristic sees the full state (placements so
far, station availability, all orders/dishes/steps) and decides which step
to commit next.
