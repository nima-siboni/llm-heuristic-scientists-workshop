"""Runtime helpers for executing an LLM-authored heuristic.

Two helpers used by discover.py:

  - `time_limit(seconds)` — SIGALRM-based timeout, so a buggy `priority`
    that loops forever can't stall the discovery loop.
  - `compile_priority(code)` — exec the LLM's code in a fresh namespace
    with the domain dataclasses and `earliest_start` injected, then
    extract the resulting `priority` callable.

Note: this is *not* a security sandbox. `exec` gives the generated code
full Python access. Treat the discovery loop's process as throwaway.
